  <p> VEP can use plugin modules written in Perl to add functionality to
  the software. Plugins are a powerful way to extend, filter and manipulate the
  output of VEP.</p>

  <p> Example functionality: </p>

  <ul>
  	<li> Running additional Ensembl API code (<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/Conservation.pm">Conservation</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/LD.pm">LD</a>)</li>
  	<li> Querying an external dataset or database (<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/CADD.pm">CADD</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/dbNSFP.pm">dbNSFP</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/ExAC.pm">ExAC</a>)</li>
  	<li> Running external algorithms (<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/Condel.pm">Condel</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/MaxEntScan.pm">MaxEntScan</a>)</li>
  	<li> Filtering VEP output (<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/RankFilter.pm">RankFilter</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p> Plugins can be installed using VEP's installer script, run the
  following command to get a list of available plugins: </p>

  <pre class="code">perl INSTALL.pl -a p -g list</pre>

  <p> Some plugins are also available to use via the <a href="/Tools/VEP">VEP web interface</a>. </p>
	
	<h2 id="plugins_examples">Examples</h2>
	
	<p> We have written several example plugins that implement experimental
	functionality that we do not (yet) include in the variation API, and these
	are stored in a public github repository: </p>
	
	<p><a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins"
	target="_blank">https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins</a></p>
	
	<p> We hope that these will serve as useful examples for users implementing
	new plugins. If you have any questions about the system, or suggestions for
	enhancements please let us know on the 
  <a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev" rel="external">ensembl-dev</a> 
  mailing list. We also encourage users to share any plugins they develop; we are happy
  to accept pull requests on the VEP_plugins git repository. </p>
    
	
	<hr/>
	<h2 id="plugins_how">How it works</h2>
	
	<p>Plugins are run once VEP has finished its analysis for each line of
	the output, but before anything is printed to the output file. When each
	plugin is called (using the 'run' method) it is passed two data structures
	to use in its analysis; the first is a data structure containing all the
	data for the current line, and the second is a reference to a variation
	API object that represents the combination of a variant allele and an
	overlapping or nearby genomic feature (such as a transcript or regulatory
	region). This object provides access to all the relevant API objects that
	may be useful for further analysis by the plugin (such as the current
	VariationFeature and Transcript); please refer to the <a
	href="/info/docs/Doxygen/variation-api/index.html">variation API
	documentation</a> for more details.</p>
	
	<hr/>
	<h2 id="plugins_functionality">Functionality</h2>
	
	<p>We expect that most plugins will simply add information to the last
	column of the output file, the "Extra" column, and the plugin system assumes
	this in various places, but plugins are also free to alter the output line
	as desired.</p>
	
	<p>The only hard requirement for
	a plugin to work with VEP is that it implements a number of required
	methods (such as 'new' which should create and return an instance of this
	plugin, 'get_header_info' which should return descriptions of the type of
	data this plugin produces to be included in VEP output's header, and
	'run' which should actually perform the logic of the plugin). To make
	development of plugins easier, we suggest that users use the <a
	href="/info/docs/Doxygen/variation-api/classBio_1_1EnsEMBL_1_1Variation_1_1Utils_1_1BaseVepPlugin.html">Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepPlugin</a>
	module as their base class, which provides default implementations of all the
	necessary methods which can be overridden as required. Please refer to the
	documentation in this module for details of all required methods and for a
	simple
	example of a plugin implementation. </p>
	
	<hr/>
	<h2 id="plugins_filter">Filtering using plugins</h2>
	
	<p> A common use for plugins will be to filter the output in some way (for
	example to limit output lines to missense variants) and so we provide
	a simple mechanism to support this. The 'run' method of a plugin is assumed
	to return a reference to a hash containing information to be included in the
	output, and if a plugin should not add any data to a particular line
	it should return an empty hashref. If a plugin should instead filter a
	line and exclude it from the output, it should return 'undef' from its 'run'
	method, this also means that no further plugins will be run on the line. If
	you are developing a filter plugin, we suggest that you use the <a
	href="/info/docs/Doxygen/variation-api/classBio_1_1EnsEMBL_1_1Variation_1_1Utils_1_1BaseVepFilterPlugin.html">Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::Utils::BaseVepFilterPlugin</a>
	as your base class and then you need only override the 'include_line' method
	to return true if you want to include this line, and false otherwise. Again,
	please refer to the documentation in this module for more details and an
	example	implementation of a missense filter. </p>

	<h2 id="plugins_use">Using plugins</h2>
    
    <p> In order to run a plugin you need to include the plugin module in Perl's
    library path somehow; by default VEP includes the '&#126;/.vep/Plugins'
    directory in the path, so this is a convenient place to store plugins, but
    you are also able to include modules by any other means (e.g using the
    $PERL5LIB environment variable in Unix-like systems). You can then run a
    plugin using the <a href="vep_options.html#opt_plugin">--plugin</a> command line option, passing the name of
    the plugin module as the argument. For example, if your plugin is in a
    module called MyPlugin.pm, stored in &#126;/.vep/Plugins, you can run it
    with a command line like: </p>
	
	<pre class="code">./vep -i input.vcf --plugin MyPlugin</pre>
	
	<p> You can pass arguments to the plugin's 'new' method by including them after
	the plugin name on the command line, separated by commas, e.g.: </p>
	
	<pre class="code">./vep -i input.vcf --plugin MyPlugin,1,FOO</pre>
	
	<p> If your plugin inherits from BaseVepPlugin, you can then retrieve these
	parameters as a list from the 'params' method. </p>
	
	<p> You can run multiple plugins by supplying multiple <a href="vep_options.html#opt_plugin">--plugin</a>
	arguments. Plugins are run serially in the order in which they are specified
	on the command line, so they can be run as a pipeline, with, for example, a
	later plugin filtering output based on the results from an earlier plugin.
	Note though that the first plugin to filter a line 'wins', and any later
	plugins won't get
	run on a filtered line. </p>
	
	<hr/>
	<h2 id="plugins_intergenic">Intergenic variants</h2>
	
	<p> When a variant falls in an intergenic region, it will usually not have
	any consequence types called, and hence will not have any associated
	VariationFeatureOverlap objects. In this special case, VEP creates a new
	VariationFeatureOverlap that overlaps a feature of type "Intergenic". To
	force your plugin to handle these, you must add "Intergenic" to the feature
	types that it will recognize; you do this by writing your own feature_types
	sub-routine:</p>
	
	<pre class="code sh_perl sh_sourceCode">sub feature_types {
    return ['Transcript', 'Intergenic'];
}</pre>
	
	<p> This will cause your plugin to handle any variation features that
	overlap transcripts or intergenic regions. To also include any regulatory
	features, you should use the generic type "Feature":</p>
	
	<pre class="code sh_perl sh_sourceCode">sub feature_types {
    return ['Feature', 'Intergenic'];
}</pre>
